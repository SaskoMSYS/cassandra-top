Installing cass_top
===================

cass_top is easy to install:
 
Dependencies

- cass_top is a single bash file called 'cass_top' that runs on linux or Mac OS X.
- Download it and make it executable with 'chmod 755 cass_top'
- You need a running Cassandra cluster with nodetool (and Java).
- If your cluster is authenticated, then JMX_USERNAME and JMX_PASSWORD need to be set in your environment, usually in cassandra-env.sh
- There's several user-serviceable variables at the top of the cass_top file if you want to set the nodetool or logging path, etc.
- You need to pick a node domain name or IP address to connect to.
- That's it!


Usage
-----

usage: cass_top [connection_host=localhost] [keyspace=all] [one character option=none]

I usually start it like this:

./cass_top 1.2.3.4

After it starts, press 'h' for a detailed help screen or 'q' to quit (same as linux top.)

You can dim or brighten the cluster status screen colors by pressing '1' or '2'.


Getting Involved
----------------

There's many versions of Cassandra and even more flavors of Linux out there, so try it out and let me know of any problems.

If you download all of the cass_top project files, then you can run the tests with 'HOST=1.2.3.4 make test'

(I wrote and tested cass_top on CentOS 5.10 Linux (bash 3.2.25(1)-release) and an 8-node Cassandra 2.0.9 cluster.)

Please email me if you have any suggestions, bug reports or patches.
